        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Imangali, and I live in Saryagash. I enjoy playing football and tennis in my free time, as they keep me active and competitive. I’m also an adventurous reader, with a love for books like The Hobbit and Harry Potter. Currently, I’m studying at JIHC College, where I’m a 2nd-year student working towards my future goals.</p>
